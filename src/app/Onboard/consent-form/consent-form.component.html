                                   Regular physical activity is fun and healthy, and increasingly more people are starting to become more active every day. Being more active is very safe for most people. However, some people should check with their doctor before they
                                   start becoming much more physically active.

                                   If you are planning to become much more physically active than you are now, start by answering the seven questions in the box below. If you are between the ages of 15 and 69, the PAR-Q will tell you if you should check with your
                                   doctor before you start. If you are over 69 years of age, and you are not used to being very active, check with your doctor.
